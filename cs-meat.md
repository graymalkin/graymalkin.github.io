Hi all,

I don't remember when the last #cs-meat was, but it must be coming up to 10 years ago now.

Folks who are interested so far:

 - `zebr`
 - Julie
 - `bunu`
 - `Elfy_Sheep`
 - `Penguin`
 - `Mex`
 - `Tim`
 - `graymalkin`

**Venue**: The Camden Eye

**Date**: Tentative: _Friday 11th April_, meet at 6pm?

If there isn't a majority for this date we can do a doodle poll or something.

Hopefully see you in April,

Simon

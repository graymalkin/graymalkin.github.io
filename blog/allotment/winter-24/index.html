<p>My partner and I have recently taken on an allotment here in
Canterbury. While I’m not totally new to allotments—my mum took one on
when I was a teenager—this will be my first attempt without
“supervision”. My partner has no allotment experience, but she grew veg
with her father as a child. We’d like to grow some of the veg we enjoy
most, I’d like some cut flowers, and we’d both like some oddities which
are hard to get from the supermarket.</p>
<h1 id="what-weve-taken-on"><span class="headline-word">What</span>
<span class="headline-word">we’ve</span> <span
class="headline-word">taken</span> <span
class="headline-word">on</span></h1>
<p>It is a half-plot, which measures 5 <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_(unit)">perch</a> (125sqm),
there’s some minor existing infrastructure from the previous holder:</p>
<ul>
<li>A almost completely de-glazed greenhouse frame</li>
<li>An old poly tunnel frame which was used to net fruit bushes</li>
<li>A strawberry patch constructed as a raised bed</li>
<li>A pile of misc short bits of wood, metal, and a lot of plastic
sheeting</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../images/initial-large.jpg"><img
src="../images/initial.jpg" style="width:100.0%"
alt="State of the plot when we received our keys" /></a></p>
<p>The plot is overgrown with couch grass and raspberry canes. At the
back of the plot there is a significant pile of plastics and waste.
There is an existing small compost bin, but is very undersized for a
plot this large.</p>
<p>The first task is clearing weeds and rubbish!</p>
<h1 id="november-progress"><span class="headline-word">November</span>
<span class="headline-word">progress</span></h1>
<p>I’ve cleared weeds across about half the plot and dug over maybe 15%
(including the greenhouse). The grass is quite difficult to remove, it
sends out rhizomes underground which will sprout more grass if not fully
removed. We call it couch grass. Every time I turn over a fork of soil,
I then need to dig through by hand to collect all the spaghetti-like
rhizomes. The rhizomes are very brittle and only a tiny bit will allow
more grass to grow. It’ll probably take me a few years to get on top of
it.</p>
<p><a href="../images/digging-over-large.jpg"><img

alt="Dug over about 10sqm" /></a></p>
<p>My partner and I have cleared out the greenhouse and dug it over too.
Apparently, it was glazed with plastic which has not survived the winds.
We have found we can probably get some used greenhouse glass cheaply on
Facebook Marketplace, so we’ll re-glaze it with glass in the spring.</p>
<p><a href="../images/greenhouse-large.jpg"><img
src="../images/greenhouse.jpg" style="width:100.0%"
alt="Greenhouse cleared" /></a></p>
<p>With the things left behind by the previous holders of the plot, my
partner has made a couple of quick compost heaps.</p>
<p><a href="../images/compost-large.jpg"><img
src="../images/compost.jpg" style="width:100.0%"
alt="Compost heaps" /></a></p>
<p>My partner has cleared her way to the west boundary. We have filled
10 black sacks with rubbish to take to the local tip so far. Most of it
was a poly-tunnel cover which had severely deteriorated in the
sun/elements and was just festering microplastics everywhere. We also
found an old air bed which we think was being used to suppress weeds.
Allotments here have a strong ‘reuse and make do’ ethos, which I really
like, but unfortunately it can sometimes go over the edge into just
storing rubbish. We’re going to do our best to avoid plastics where we
can, especially ones which will perish quickly in the sun.</p>
<p><a href="../images/clearing-large.jpg"><img
src="../images/clearing.jpg" style="width:100.0%"
alt="Compost heaps" /></a></p>
<p>We broke down the old strawberry patch, pulled up the weed proof
membrane, and have begun digging that over too.</p>
<p><a href="../images/removed-raised-bed-large.jpg"><img
src="../images/removed-raised-bed.jpg" style="width:100.0%"
alt="Compost heaps" /></a></p>
<p>The soil from under the membrane is quite poor. It is very heavy clay
with little life left except couch grass rhizomes, there aren’t even
many worms. Hopefully this winter I’ll be able to mulch at least this
portion of the allotment with well-rotted manure to improve the
soil.</p>
<h2 id="storm-bert"><span class="headline-word">Storm</span> <span
class="headline-word">Bert</span></h2>
<p>Storm Bert did some damage to our fence at home, and blew over the
<em>almost</em> de-glazed greenhouse. In hindsight, I should have known
leaving a couple of panels of glass/polycarbonate in the greenhouse
frame would be a mistake—what little glass remained acted as an
effective sail, causing the greenhouse to blow over and fold in half. It
collapsed onto the adjacent polytunnel frame, which buckled even further
out of shape but did protect the established fruit bushes from
damage.</p>
<p><a href="../images/greenhouse-damage-large.jpg"><img
src="../images/greenhouse-damage.jpg" style="width:100.0%"
alt="Greenhouse damage" /></a></p>
<p>After the storm passed, I went back up to inspect the damage.
Thankfully, it’s worse than it looks. Greenhouses are made of
surprisingly sturdy aluminium extrusions, and while a few bits were bent
a little, the greenhouse went back together quite easily over an hour of
faff. A few screws were missing (which I knew about before the storm)
and the roof was extremely wobbly as a result. A previous tennant of the
plot had wired parts of the frame together with thick horticultural
wire, but it is not really the same as proper nuts and bolts.
Thankfully, a pack of 50 greenhouse bolts is £6 from Amazon–so I have
also bolted it back together more securely.</p>
<p><a href="../images/greenhouse-re-erected-large.jpg"><img
src="../images/greenhouse-re-erected.jpg" style="width:100.0%"
alt="Greenhouse re-erected" /></a></p>
<p>A task for this winter is to re-build the greenhouse base. The
existing base is made of 2×4 batons and 2×2 stakes which have all but
rotted completely through. The greenhouse was originally screwed to that
base with wood screws, but when I try putting new screws in after
re-building the greenhouse on the base, the screws push into the rotton
wood with my thumb, and come out just as easily. I am unsure exactly
what my plans are for the base, there’s a trade off between longevity
and cost. The more expensive but very secure option is to build a 4×4
oak frame secured to the ground with big <a
href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/PWU-Ground-Sleeve-Screw-Anchor/dp/B07L34F3FH">ground
screws</a>. But then, part of the fun of allotment-ing is doing stuff on
the cheap: so I might re-use some 3×12 boards which were part of the old
strawberry patch I’ve dug out. The bottom half of those boards have
rotten through, but there’s still plenty of good wood left.</p>
<h1 id="plans-for-the-spring"><span class="headline-word">Plans</span>
<span class="headline-word">for</span> <span
class="headline-word">the</span> <span
class="headline-word">Spring</span></h1>
<p>At home, we have a 5ft × 7ft (1.5m × 2.1m) shed, which we store bikes
and gardening equipment in. It is in a part of the garden which is best
suited for a greenhouse, and while we’re pleased that there’s a
greenhouse at the allotment, we’d like one at home too. To that end,
we’re going to get a smaller bike shed for home and relocate our 5×7
shed to the allotment where space has been cleared under west boundary.
This plan will let us re-use our shed, make space for a greenhouse, and
provide a shed at the allotment all at once!</p>
<p>Some things we will want to plant out directly, like onions and
carrots, but others (especially flowers) will need to be grown in
seed-trays. So we will need to rebuild the greenhouse base, and re-glaze
it ready for seedlings to get started in the early spring. I’m hoping to
get this done over the winter, but the days are short and the weather
can be terrible, so time will tell if I manage this.</p>
<p>I would like to mostly grow in raised beds, but I’m a little
concerned about the costs. Timber prices shot up around 2022 with the
start of the current war in Ukraine, and haven’t really gone back down.
We’re going to try and buy used scaffolding boards to make the sides of
the raised beds, but at about £15 per 3m scaffolding board, and with a
desire to make 3×1.5×0.5 beds, it’ll be about £90 for the sides alone
and another £20-ish for the corner posts, per raised bed! That cost is
not in the spirit of cheap gardening that allotments promote.</p>

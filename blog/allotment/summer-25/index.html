<p>We bought a few tools from Facebook marketplace. First of which was a
petrol lawnmower – we inherited an electric strimmer when we took on our
patch, but now the summer is here we need something a bit more robust to
keep the paths and grass in-check. So after a couple of evenings of
searching, we found a decent lawn mower 2nd hand for £65 on Facebook
marketplace.</p>
<p>The same week, we also contacted else whose allotment association
forbids glass on site and needed to get rid of the glass from his
greenhouse. He was very generously giving it away for free, so we popped
up on a Tuesday night and collected many 2ft by 2ft panes of glass, and
some triangles for the ends! Thank you very much Pawel!</p>

<p>In the UK we’ve had several popular ways to sell second hand goodies
online, eBay, GumTree and FreeCycle used to be dominant. All of those
are free to browse without an account, and are not run by a global mega
corporation that profits from the subversion of democratic processes in
many countries (see: <a

Marketplace is by far the most popular way to sell second hand stuff
like lawnmowers, greenhouses, etc. After the Brexit vote and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica">Cambridge
Analytica revelations</a> I deleted my Facebook account, which makes
even browsing Facebook marketplace off-limits. My partner does maintain
a Facebook account so between us, we can navigate buying 2nd hand goods,
but it is cumbersome.</p>
<p>Facebook marketplace is also a bit too bereft of features. Clearly
lots of people are taken for a ride as buyers and sellers and there’s a
distinct culture of mistrust. The seller of the lawn mower seemed taken
aback that we turned up on-time, with the correct money, and didn’t mess
him about. Similarly, Pawel told us that even <em>giving away</em> the
glass for free he’d been messed around by 4 people before us! Perhaps
this is just the nature of selling stuff in-person but being initiated
online, but it seems like a sorry state of affairs.</p>
<p>I could (and might) write a whole extra rant about portions of civic
society being walled off behind a Facebook/Twitter account, but I’ll
save that for a different time.</p>

<p>The frame is sturdy and secured to a new base, as of February’s
work.</p>
<p>With all this free glass, we need to fit it to the greenhouse. To do
this we had to get a few new items. The rubber gaskets which the glass
rests on had all perished, so must be replaced. Apparently a 6x8
greenhouse requires 64m (!) of glazing strip. We also need some normal
greenhouse hardware: W-clips to hold the glass in the frame and Z-clips
to stack 2x2 panes of glass on top of one another. These are readily
available from hardware stores and Amazon.</p>

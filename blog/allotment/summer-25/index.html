<span class="headline-word">conundrum</span></h1>
<p>We’ve really struggled to grow plants this year. As usual, we started
seedlings under a decent quality grow lamp, and they germinated fairly
fast and got to a few inches tall. The chillies especially just seemed
to stop growing. This was frustrating, but made all the more frustrating
by our difficulty in identifying the root-cause. The plants showed some
signs of distress from water, but nothing serious, and the leaves were
slightly yellowing. We thought this was because of water and/or light
issues, so we tinkered with watering schedules, light intensity, and
distance from the light to the plants. The mild yellowing went away, but
the plants remained stunted. We also thought it might be pests,
especially fungus gnats, but again we did some pest control and the
plants didn’t seem to improve. All this experimenting took several
weeks. It affected several types of plants, our chillies were the worst
affected, but it also seemed to make our tomatoes and sunflowers
struggle too. The only plant not affected seemed to be the cosmos. We
suspected a nutrient deficiency in the compost, so we switched from
<em>Westland Multi-purpose Compost with John Innes № 3</em>, to
<em>Miracle Grow All-purpose Compost</em>. This was a bit of a mistake,
this compost (also peat free) retained moisture far more effectively
than the Westland compost, and the roots of the tomatoes rotted off.</p>
<p>In hindsight, the cosmos were probably giving us the information we
needed. According to the RHS, cosmos is well adapted to poor soils, and
flowers more prolifically in those conditions too. All-in-all it’s a
significant damper on our season’s growing, but we’re willing to “cheat”
a bit and buy nursery plants.</p>

<p>Mum always grew half a dozen of these and couldn’t give the

<p>The most exciting plant is an aubergine, I’ve never grown these

<p>We bought a few tools from Facebook marketplace. First of which was a
petrol lawnmower – we inherited an electric strimmer when we took on our
patch, but now the summer is here we need something a bit more robust to
keep the paths and grass in-check. So after a couple of evenings of
searching, we found a decent lawn mower 2nd hand for £65 on Facebook
marketplace.</p>
<p>The same week, we also contacted else whose allotment association
forbids glass on site and needed to get rid of the glass from his
greenhouse. He was very generously giving it away for free, so we popped
up on a Tuesday night and collected many 2ft by 2ft panes of glass, and
some triangles for the ends! Thank you very much Pawel!</p>
<p>I could (and might) write a whole extra rant about portions of civic
society being walled off behind a Facebook/Twitter account, but I’ll
save that for a different time…</p>

class="headline-word">greenhouse</span></h1>
<p>The frame is sturdy and secured to a new base, as of February’s
work.</p>
<p>With all this free glass, we need to fit it to the greenhouse. To do
this we had to get a few new items. The rubber gaskets which the glass
rests on had all perished, so must be replaced. Apparently a 6x8
greenhouse requires 64m (!) of glazing strip. We also need some normal
greenhouse hardware: W-clips to hold the glass in the frame and Z-clips
to stack 2x2 panes of glass on top of one another. These are readily
available from hardware stores and Amazon.</p>

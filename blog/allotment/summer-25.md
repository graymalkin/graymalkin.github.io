# Finding second-hand gold

We bought a few tools from Facebook marketplace.
First of which was a petrol lawnmower -- we inherited an electric strimmer when we took on our patch, but now the summer is here we need something a bit more robust to keep the paths and grass in-check.
So after a couple of evenings of searching, we found a decent lawn mower 2nd hand for Â£65 on Facebook marketplace.

The same week, we also contacted else whose allotment association forbids glass on site and needed to get rid of the glass from his greenhouse.
He was very generously giving it away for free, so we popped up on a Tuesday night and collected many 2ft by 2ft panes of glass, and some triangles for the ends!
Thank you very much Pawel!

## Second hand market in the UK
In the UK we've had several popular ways to sell second hand goodies online, eBay, GumTree and FreeCycle used to be dominant.
All of those are free to browse without an account, and are not run by a global mega corporation that profits from the subversion of democratic processes in many countries (see: [Cambridge Analytica][ca], [Foreign interference in elections via Facebook][foreign-campaigning], [Genocide of Rohingya in Myanmar][myanmar], [Indian WhatsApp Lynchings][whatsapp], to name a few).
Sadly in the UK today, Facebook Marketplace is by far the most popular way to sell second hand stuff like lawnmowers, greenhouses, etc.
After the Brexit vote and [Cambridge Analytica revelations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica) I deleted my Facebook account, which makes even browsing Facebook marketplace off-limits.
My partner does maintain a Facebook account so between us, we can navigate buying 2nd hand goods, but it is cumbersome.

Facebook marketplace is also a bit too bereft of features.
Clearly lots of people are taken for a ride as buyers and sellers and there's a distinct culture of mistrust.
The seller of the lawn mower seemed taken aback that we turned up on-time, with the correct money, and didn't mess him about.
Similarly, Pawel told us that even _giving away_ the glass for free he'd been messed around by 4 people before us!
Perhaps this is just the nature of selling stuff in-person but being initiated online, but it seems like a sorry state of affairs.

I could (and might) write a whole extra rant about portions of civic society being walled off behind a Facebook/Twitter account, but I'll save that for a different time.

# Reglazing the allotment greenhouse

The frame is sturdy and secured to a new base, as of February's work.

With all this free glass, we need to fit it to the greenhouse.
To do this we had to get a few new items.
The rubber gaskets which the glass rests on had all perished, so must be replaced.
Apparently a 6x8 greenhouse requires 64m (!) of glazing strip.
We also need some normal greenhouse hardware: W-clips to hold the glass in the frame and Z-clips to stack 2x2 panes of glass on top of one another.
These are readily available from hardware stores and Amazon.

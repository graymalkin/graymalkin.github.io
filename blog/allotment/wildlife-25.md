This year it feels like there's more wildlife about than there has been in previous years.
Both in quantity of individuals, and in variety of species.
To try and keep track, and maybe feel somewhat positive about things, I thought I should keep a list of what I've spotted.

## Insects

Butterflies are one of the insects I've noticed far more of this year.
I don't know if that's because I'm spending time at the allotment now, which is a relative haven for all insects, or if there's been an actual surge in numbers.
Anecdotally my friends say they've also noticed more butterflies this year---hopefully this isn't a one-off good year, and we have more to come!

## Birds

_I don't put out bird food, I'm worried about a bird feeder becoming a buffet for my cats._

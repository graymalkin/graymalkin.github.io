<p>Increasingly access to society requires a username and password.</p>
<p>I think that in itself isn’t so bad, I’m happy that government
services are more efficient for me to interact with. Higher degrees of
automation, more information available, and better tracking of processes
are all excellent improvements. Automation reduces latency, no more
waiting 5-10 business days for paperwork to make it through the post;
internal sorting; data entry; manual triage; <em>ad nauseam</em>. More
information helps me make better decisions, I can find out about the MOT
history of any car I might think about buying; I can see all the
planning applications for my area on one map; I can understand what my
student loan payments were this year and the exact balance outstanding.
Process tracking means I can keep track of what’s happening to me, my
data, and my life, and to keep systems honest if they go wrong.</p>
<p>That being said, a lot of civic society – especially the parts which
don’t involve the government directly – require a login to a 3rd party
service. Especially with social media, but also now with news, things
which were mostly public are now hidden behind at least a login-wall, if
not a pay wall too<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"

<p>In the UK we’ve had several popular ways to sell second hand goodies
online, eBay, GumTree and FreeCycle used to be dominant. All of those
are free to browse without an account, and are not run by a global mega
corporation that profits from the subversion of democratic processes in
many countries (see: <a

href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_WhatsApp_lynchings">Indian
WhatsApp Lynchings</a>, to name a few). Sadly in the UK today, Facebook
Marketplace is by far the most popular way to sell second hand stuff
like lawnmowers, greenhouses, etc. After the Brexit vote and the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica">Cambridge
Analytica revelations</a> I deleted my Facebook account, which makes
even browsing Facebook marketplace off-limits. My partner does maintain
a Facebook account so between us, we can navigate buying 2nd hand goods,
but it is cumbersome.</p>
<p>Facebook marketplace is also a bit too bereft of features. Clearly
lots of people are taken for a ride as buyers and sellers and there’s a
distinct culture of mistrust. The seller of the lawn mower seemed taken
aback that we turned up on-time, with the correct money, and didn’t mess
him about. Similarly, <a
href="/blog/allotment/summer-25/#finding-second-hand-gold">Pawel</a>
told us that even <em>giving away</em> the glass for free he’d been
messed around by 4 people before us! Perhaps this is just the nature of
selling stuff in-person but being initiated online, but it seems like a
sorry state of affairs.</p>
<p>The local car boot sale hasn’t run since the COVID restrictions began
in 2020, with much of the sale of 2nd hand goods going online to
Facebook Marketplace.</p>
<h2 id="politics"><span class="headline-word">Politics</span></h2>
<p>My local MP only appears to share her opinions to columns behind pay
walls and on her Facebook page. My local residents’ group organises
exclusively through Facebook, local councillors spend much of their time
communicating to their constituents via Facebook. The local Labour Party
relied on WhatsApp groups and a Facebook group for communication within
the local party. By all accounts this dependence on WhatsApp is
reflected all the way through British politics to the very top.</p>
<h2 id="online-clubs"><span class="headline-word">Online</span> <span
class="headline-word">clubs</span></h2>
<p>This one might seem odd, of course online clubs need a login – logins
are identities online! I agree with this, but there is a proliferation
of dis-integrated services around clubs. The most obvious example being
Discord. Even our allotment association has a large social component
behind in a Facebook group.</p>
<hr />
<p>We’re in an unfortunate position where there’s hostile capture of
users. Users are in a platform because important parts of their lives
depend on, say, Facebook Messenger—and in particular their access to
people they care about is gated by these platforms too. It is therefore
really hard to leave. Facebook says it connects people and this is true,
but what Facebook doesn’t say is that people could and would connect
without Facebook as well. Today, the metaphorical digital town square is
run almost entirely by Facebook.</p>
<p>The Online Safety Act has made it harder for small groups to manage
fora, too. Any administrators of social media are responsible for a wide
array of potential harms that may come to children, making the risk of
small running a small forum too great for many. This risk isn’t just for
old-school phpBB forums either, newer social media platforms like the
de-centralised Mastodon suffer the same exposure to the Online Safety
Act.</p>
<p>For local communities, traditional newsletters and physical notice
boards might be part of the solution. Churches across the country have
been quite good at this, in part I expect because of their demographics
not being very online. My home village has a monthly newsletter which is
sponsored and largely organised by volunteers of the church.</p>
<p>My allotment association does send out a monthly email newsletter,
which has proven quite useful. It also has a monthly plant swap meetups,
which is good for community building but also good to disseminate
information.</p>

<p>This year’s BarCamp Canterbury was held at the MakerSpace in the new
Engineering building at Canterbury Christ Church university. I gave a
short talk on building EBikes, the slides are available <a

<!-- # Manifesto: Bikes as a hacking platform -->
<h1 id="technical-aspects-of-ebikes">Technical Aspects of EBikes</h1>
<p>To make this a somewhat useful (I hope) resource, I will enumerate
some of the things I’ve learned about EBikes, and how to build them.</p>
<h2 id="ebikes-and-the-law">EBikes and the law</h2>
<p>I live in the UK, so I need to build bikes which fit within the UK
law. I am not a laywer.</p>
<p>The UK law is largely derived from European law, which is useful as
European EBikes are largely legal in the UK. They are technically
defined as “Electrically Assisted Pedal Cycles” (EAPCs). Specifically
the laws are derived from British Standard and European Norm BS EN
15194:2017 <span class="citation"
data-cites="BSEN15194:2017">(<span>“Cycles - Electrically Power Assisted
Cycles - EPAC Bicycles”</span> 2017)</span>. EBikes you find in
high-street bike shops should all conform to that standard, and the
testing methodology specified – but there’s some interesting questions
to be raised motor specifications in particular, but more on that in a
second.</p>
<p>Mainly, the concern for legality in the UK is how power can be
applied by the rider and the maximum power available. The exact details
are available on the GOV.UK website<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, but I’ll outline them
here:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="what-counts-as-an-eapc">What counts as an EAPC</h3>
<p>An EAPC must have pedals that can be used to propel it.</p>
<p>It must show either:</p>
<ul>
<li>the power output</li>
<li>the manufacturer of the motor</li>
</ul>
<p>It must also show either:</p>
<ul>
<li>the battery’s voltage</li>
<li>the maximum speed of the bike</li>
</ul>
<p>Its electric motor:</p>
<ul>
<li>must have a maximum power output of 250 watts</li>
<li>should not be able to propel the bike when it’s travelling more than
15.5mph</li>
</ul>
<p>An EAPC can have more than 2 wheels (for example, a tricycle).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These rules to me don’t make a great deal of sense. The maximum power
output of a motor is a slightly odd thing, most motors have a very wide
power envelope, and performance will depend on airflow, voltage, and
current. Many 250W labelled motors will work fine at 500W, if cooled
adequately. Many EBike 1000W hub-motors will run at 2.5kW with minor
cooling modification<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Similarly, having a 1000W motor run
at 250W by a brushless motor controller is totally practical, so
building a bike which can work on-road legally and off-road with higher
power leads a bike builder to need to label their motor as, say, 1000W
even if it’s not operated at that wattage.</p>
<p>They don’t make sense for other reasons too: a generic motor
manufacturer name, and the voltage of the battery have almost no baring
on describing the performance of an EBike. A 72v system connected to a
9Continent motor does not tell you a whether the motor is conformant,
what wattage the bike is designed for, whether it is speed limitted
etc.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-ebike-drive">Types of EBike Drive</h2>
<p>There’s a few drive train architectures for EBikes, you will need to
pick one, and I have a favourite, but honestly all of these are mostly
okay.</p>
<h3 id="brushless-vs-brushed">Brushless vs Brushed</h3>
<p>There are two types of motor available: brushed, and brushless.
Brushed motors are cheap, simple, but have a lower power density than
their brushless counterparts. Conversely, brushless motors are typically
more powerful, a more complex to drive, and a bit more expensive. The
cost part is counter-acted by the availability of EBike parts designed
to work with brushless architectures. Loads of EBike motors are
available on Amazon which can just drop straight into a regular bike,
you won’t need to build/buy custom mounting brackets for industrial
motors.</p>
<h3 id="hub-vs-bottom-bracket">Hub vs Bottom Bracket</h3>
<p>Another choice is where the motor goes on your bike. For brushed
motors there’s little choice: it’d better be a bottom bracket motor,
i.e. a motor which mounts at the pedals of the bike. Those brushed
options are normally connected to the back wheel by a chain on the
left-hand side (the other side to the pedals’ chain). For brushless
motors the motor mounts in a way that the power can be transferred
through the pedals as a Pedal Assist system, so you’d only have one
chain.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-batteries">Understanding Batteries</h2>
<h3 id="lead-acid-vs-lithium">Lead acid vs Lithium</h3>
<p>There are two common rechargeable battery chemistries, lead acid and
lithium ion<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. Lead acid is quite cheap, and
substantially more forgiving to charge. It is arguably the ‘safe’
option, although I would argue that easy management of</p>
<h3 id="technical-specifications-of-batteries">Technical specifications
of batteries</h3>
<p><strong>S and P rating.</strong> Batteries are specified by the
number and configuration of the cells.</p>
<p>The S rating is the number of cells arranged in series, this defines
pack voltage.</p>
<p>The P rating is the nbumber of strings of cells arranged in parallel,
this defines the pack’s capacity and the maximum current draw.</p>
<p><strong>C rating.</strong> The C rating is a multiplier of the
battery (or cell’s) Ah rating to give you a charge/discharge current in
A. It’s a bit of an odd number, but it can help with napkin maths about
how quickly a cycle on a battery will take.</p>
<p>Let’s take a 10Ah battery to start with.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I do a 1C discharge, it will have a current draw of 10A, and
discharge in 1 hour.</li>
<li>If I do a 0.2C discharge, I will draw 2A, and it will discharge in 5
hours.</li>
<li>If I do a 2C discharge, I will draw 20A, and it will discharge in
half an hour.</li>
</ul>
<p>C ratings are given for charge and discharge. A typical 18650 battery
will be good for about 1C continuous discharge, and 0.2C charge. Lower C
numbers will result in better long-term energy storage with your battery
pack.</p>
<p>Each charge/discharge cycle mechanically alters the structure of the
inside of your cells, and the more aggressive the charge/discharge the
more the internal structure changes. These changes mean the battery
stores less energy – so using lower C ratings will mean your battery
lasts longer.</p>
<h3 id="designing-a-battery-pack">Designing a battery pack</h3>
<p>You will need to know your system voltage, the type of cell you will
use, and motor wattage. These specifications will essentially define a
minimum pack size to safely (electrically) operate your bike.</p>
<p>Say, you are going to use Samsung 29E cells, to operate a 250W EBike
with a 24v system voltage. How do you pick the pack size?</p>
<p>Well, first off is the voltage. You’d like the <em>nominal</em>
voltage of the pack to be 24v. The nominal voltage of a single
Lithium-ion cell is 3.7v. We shall first calculate the S rating.</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mtable><mtr><mtd columnalign="right"><mi>S</mi></mtd><mtd columnalign="left"><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">⌈</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>V</mi><mtext mathvariant="normal">system</mtext></msub><msub><mi>V</mi><mtext mathvariant="normal">cell</mtext></msub></mfrac><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">⌉</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign="right"><mi>S</mi></mtd><mtd columnalign="left"><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">⌈</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>24</mn><mi>v</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>3.7</mn><mi>v</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">⌉</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">⌈</mo><mn>6.48</mn><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">⌉</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>7</mn></mtd></mtr></mtable><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">
\begin{align}
    S &amp;= \left\lceil \frac{V_\text{system}}{V_\text{cell}} \right\rceil \\
    S &amp;= \left\lceil \frac{24v}{3.7v} \right\rceil = \lceil 6.48 \rceil = 7
\end{align}
</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>So, we must build a 7S pack. Okay. Now how many strings of cells do
we need in parallel? We need to do some unit conversion for this. Let’s
take our 250W motor, running on a 24v pack – what current does it draw?
Well,
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>250</mn><mi>W</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>24</mn><mi>v</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>10.41</mn><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{250W}{24v} = 10.41A</annotation></semantics></math>.
We should add a bit of headroom here, let’s build a battery pack which
can comfortably accommodate a 15A current draw. Okay, how many cells in
parallel do we need? Consulting the data sheet for the Samsung 29E cells
we’re using, we can see that they have a continuous discharge rating of
2.75A (1C discharge), but that can hurt the cycle life of the battery,
i.e. how quickly the energy storage will deteriorate with
charge/discharge cycles. Let’s take that as a maximum though, and find
out what P rating we’d need.</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mtable><mtr><mtd columnalign="right"><mi>P</mi></mtd><mtd columnalign="left"><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">⌈</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>I</mi><mtext mathvariant="normal">max</mtext></msub><msub><mi>I</mi><mtext mathvariant="normal">cell</mtext></msub></mfrac><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">⌉</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign="right"><mi>P</mi></mtd><mtd columnalign="left"><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">⌈</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>15</mn><mtext mathvariant="normal">A</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>2.75</mn><mtext mathvariant="normal">A</mtext></mrow></mfrac><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">⌉</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">⌈</mo><mn>5.45</mn><mtext mathvariant="normal">A</mtext><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">⌉</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>6</mn><mtext mathvariant="normal">A</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">
\begin{align}
    P &amp;= \left\lceil \frac{I_\text{max}}{I_\text{cell}} \right\rceil\\
    P &amp;= \left\lceil \frac{15\text{A}}{2.75\text{A}} \right\rceil = \lceil 5.45\text{A} \rceil = 6\text{A}
\end{align}
</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>So we should build at a minimum a 7S6P pack, which will contain 42
cells. We can also now pick a charger: a CC/CV charger which is less
than the 0.2C charge rate of the battery will suffice. Our total Ah
capacity of the battery is
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>*</mo><msub><mi>I</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>6</mn><mo>*</mo><mn>2.9</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>17.4</mn><mi>A</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P * I_{cell} = 6 * 2.9 = 17.4Ah</annotation></semantics></math>,
so a 0.2C charge rate would mean the maximum charger size we should use
is about 3.5A.</p>
<p>Most commercial batteries are sold by their Ah rating, not their Wh
rating, but Wh is the unit of energy, so in my opinion it’s more
useful.</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mtable><mtr><mtd columnalign="right"><mi>E</mi></mtd><mtd columnalign="left"><mo>=</mo><mi>S</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>P</mi><mo>×</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mtext mathvariant="normal">cell</mtext></msub><mo>×</mo><msub><mtext mathvariant="normal">Ah</mtext><mtext mathvariant="normal">cell</mtext></msub></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign="right"><mi>E</mi></mtd><mtd columnalign="left"><mo>=</mo><mn>7</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>6</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>3.7</mn><mi>v</mi><mo>×</mo><mn>2.9</mn><mtext mathvariant="normal">Ah</mtext><mo>=</mo><mn>450</mn><mtext mathvariant="normal">Wh</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">
\begin{align}
    E &amp;= S \times P \times V_\text{cell} \times \text{Ah}_\text{cell} \\
    E &amp;= 7 \times 6 \times 3.7v \times 2.9 \text{Ah} = 450 \text{Wh}
\end{align}
</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>This is a fairly large battery, for context my commute of about 6.5
miles uses about 80 to 100Wh of energy. A 450Wh pack would last me
several days of commuting. If you plan on using the bike for serious
distances, then you can consider adding extra strings in parallel – this
won’t change the voltage, only increase the maximum continuous current
you can draw, and increase the battery pack’s overall energy
storage.</p>
<h3 id="picking-a-battery-management-system">Picking a battery
management system</h3>
<p>The battery management system is essential for allowing you to safely
charge and discharge a lithium battery. Mistreating lithium batteries,
especially when charging can cause fires. It ensures that each string of
parallel cells is charged and discharged evenly with respect to the
others (this is called balancing), the BMS also provides under-voltage,
over-voltage, and over-current protection. They are designed for
specific S-rated battery packs. A 7S BMS will balance and maintain a 7S
battery.</p>
<p>There’s a few dimensions you need to look at to pick a BMS: - Your
battery’s S-rating - The maximum current you’d like to draw (plus some
margin) - Common port vs. discrete ports</p>
<p>The only one that’s interesting here is the common vs discrete port:
common port BMSes allow you to charge the battery through the same
connections that the battery is discharged via. For EBike applications
common port is what I’d recommend, as it means you can do regenerative
breaking easily, if your controller supports it. The downside of common
port is that if the battery is in-circuit the bike will be powered up by
the charger.</p>
<h1 id="building-your-own-custom-lithium-pack">Building your own custom
lithium pack</h1>
<p>Okay, so you know what size and configuration battery to build now,
how do you actually build it?</p>
<h2 id="bill-of-materials">Bill of Materials</h2>
<p>Let’s make a shopping list for the 7S6P pack that we designed in the
previous section.</p>
<ul>
<li>42 (7*6) Samsung 29E 18650 cells</li>
<li>28 1x3 18650 radiator clips</li>
<li>3 meters of 100% 2mm x 7mm nickel strip.</li>
<li>1 7S BMS, common port, 20A.</li>
<li>1 CC/CV charger, 29.4v, 2.5A</li>
<li>10 AWG silicone wire</li>
<li>XT-60 connectors (one female, two male)</li>
<li>Optional barrel connector</li>
<li>Kapton tape</li>
<li>Large diameter heatshrink</li>
<li>Some battery case</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tin snips (or very heavy-duty scissors)</li>
<li>Spot welder</li>
<li>Soldering iron</li>
<li>Some wide masking tape</li>

<li>Benchtop power supply</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A note on nickel strip.</strong> With the nickel strip,
there’s a lot of fake listings which claim you’re buying 100% nickel
strip, but actually it’s nickel plated steel. Nickel plated steel has a
high resistivity and isn’t suitable for high current connections in a
battery pack. To be sure you got nickel, you can test by sanding the
surface of the metal, dabbing it with some salt water and leaving it for
a few days to see if rust develops. No rust? It’s 100% nickel!</p>
<h2 id="step-0-play-with-your-spot-welder">Step 0: Play with your spot
welder</h2>
<p>It’s worth getting to know your spot welder, cut a handful of short
strips of nickel and weld them together. You should be able to get a
feel for the settings for your welder which creates a solid weld without
blowing straight through the nickel. On my k-weld I found 50J about the
right energy level for 2 mm nickel strip, but YMMV.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-check-your-cells-are-balanced">Step 1: Check your cells
are balanced</h2>
<p>It is important that all the cells in the pack are at the same state
of charge before being assembled, otherwise they’ll charge each other at
their maximum discharge rate which can be a bit spicy. Check all the
cells with a multimeter, they should ideally be within 10mV of each
other. 50mV is probably fine. If it’s more than that, you’ll need to
charge/discharge them on a CC/CV benchtop power supply.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-arrange-the-cells-in-the-radiators">Step 2: Arrange the
cells in the radiators</h2>
<p>Clip together the radiators to make a 7x6 grid, and fill them with
cells. Check the polarity of your cells and arrange them such that the
first string of 7 cells has the positives on top, and the next string
has negatives, and so on. Once you’re done, clip together the radiators
for the top and push that onto the battery pack.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-begin-welding-parallel-packs">Step 3: Begin welding
parallel packs</h2>
<p>I like to mask the cells, so I can drop bits of nickel onto strips
and cause potentially dangerous shorts. Keep just the first parallel
strip visible. Measure out a length of nickel strip a little longer than
the pack. Tin the end of the strip – this is where the BMS connection
will be soldered. Begin welding! I like to make 2 welds per cell in a
cross.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-weld-series-connections">Step 4: Weld series
connections</h2>
<p>Cut a bunch of short lengths of nickel, and begin welding each series
connection using the same technique. You might need to dial up the power
on your welder a little to get good weld penetration through the extra
layer of nickel.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-add-the-bms-and-xt-60-connector">Step 5: Add the BMS and
XT-60 connector</h2>
<p>First the BMS balance wires. Connect the BMS leads to the tinned tabs
on the parallel connections from Step 3. On the 7S BMS there will be 8
balance leads to connect: the first goes to the negative connection for
the battery, each of the next 7 go to the positive connection for each
string of parallel pack. Take care not to heat up the nickel strip too
much with the soldering iron, that could damage the cells.</p>
<p>Next the charge/discharge cables. To do this, I grabbed a 10 cm
length of nickel, and soldered the 10AWG cable to that, and the cables
to the connector. The BMS common goes to the negative pole of the
battery. The BMS output goes to the negative pin of the XT-60 connector.
XT connectors are marked with + and - on their sides.</p>
<p>Then I welded the nickel strips to the battery. This prevents
damaging the cells by lingering on them with a soldering iron to solder
the heavy guage cable. Typically, batteries get the female connectors,
and the load/charger gets the male connector.</p>
<p>Tape down the BMS and the balance leads with kapton tape. You might
need to offer it up to your case to be make sure it’s put in a place
with enough space.</p>
<h2 id="step-6-heatshrink">Step 6: Heatshrink</h2>
<p>Cover your pack in heatshrink to keep it safer from particle
ingress.</p>
<h2 id="step-7-pop-it-in-the-box">Step 7: Pop it in the box</h2>
<p>Once it’s in the box, you can charge it for the first time, and begin
using it!</p>

<p>I have recently handed in my resignation notice at Kent. I recall my
former colleague (in the direct institutional sense) <a
href="https://www.humprog.org/~stephen/blog/highered/role-again.html">wrote
a blog post</a> when he left Kent, and I thought I would reflect on my
own experiences in kind.</p>
<h1 id="what-was-my-job"><span class="headline-word">What</span> <span
class="headline-word">was</span> <span class="headline-word">my</span>
<span class="headline-word">job?</span></h1>
<p>I was a <em>Research Fellow</em> at Kent. This is a fairly privileged
academic job: I had a full-time open-ended contract with only research
responsibilities. <em>The dream.</em> This meant I could lead my own
research programmes, and apply for funding as a PI. Indeed, I did apply
for funding and was successfully awarded a DASA grant to look at Rust on
Morello for Embedded Systems. The draw back of this role is that I’m
expected to find funding for most or all of my time, failure to do so
would mean I quickly find myself redundant.</p>
<p>The dream job, but at the cost of job security.</p>
<h2 id="why-am-i-leaving"><span class="headline-word">Why</span> <span
class="headline-word">am</span> <span class="headline-word">I</span>
<span class="headline-word">leaving?</span></h2>
<p>There are two major factors, the first is purely personal financial,
the second environmental.</p>
<p>The house I live in has gone up in value, which is a boon in one
sense and a curse in another. To buy my housemate out of his share I
need an increasingly high wage to satisfy the bank about mortgage
affordability. With the mortgage rate at about 6% the monthly repayments
alone swallow a very large portion of my take-home pay. Energy, food,
and services all going up by ~10-20% for food and services, and almost
doubling for energy, in the last year add extra pressure.</p>
<p>The University of Kent, like many middling HE institutions in the UK,
is starved for income. Student fees have stagnated for years, being
stuck barely above the £9000 fees that were introduced in my first year
of undergraduate back in 2012. Real-terms income to universities
per-student has deteriorated, and wages along with it. My wage as a
Research Fellow is tied indelibly to student income as it is locked to
the wage of a Lecturer.</p>
<p>This sector-wide financial problem bites especially hard at Kent. The
university is seeking second round of “automatic spine point increment”
deferral until 2024, and is not implementing the per-point UCEA
increases until September ’24 either. This in total defers about a 8%
pay increase for a year, against a backdrop of about an 10% inflation
rate.</p>
<h2 id="the-blind-spot"><span class="headline-word">The</span> <span
class="headline-word">blind</span> <span
class="headline-word">spot</span></h2>
<p>I worry that there is a bit of a blind spot for existing staff within
institutions, especially ones in the South East, to the pressures of
housing vs. wage. In my area a modest 3-bedroom semi-detached house is
around £350k. Mortgage affordability tests require a ~10% deposit (£35k)
and an income-to-loan multiplier no greater than 4.5x (£70k/pa). Hitting
this is currently only just in reach for a pair of academics, and looks
very very hard if you try to factor in children as well. For me, my
partner is doing a PhD, meaning our combined wage would not hit the £70k
threshold. In the UK median wages are around £30k, and an academic is
paid about £45k. The access to housing is fragile for the researchers
getting permanent positions around now, and a few years head start makes
all the difference.</p>
<p>Why do I call this a blind spot? Well even the potentially small
head-start that’s held by existing faculty members makes a huge
difference. Pre-pandemic the average 3-bed semi was around £300k, the
deposit around £30k, and the income threshold at a more accessible £60k.
3 years has moved homeownership from ‘within reach’ to ‘maybe
out-of-reach’ for a couple where one half is an academic. 3 more years
might leave homeownership ‘solidly out-of-reach’ for people in a similar
position.</p>
<p>Looking back to 2016 when a similar house was £250k, deposit £25k,
income required £50k, and interest rates at 1.5% – and everything was a
lot rosier.</p>
<p>Income has not kept up with inflation, and has nowhere near kept up
with <em>house price inflation</em> in the last 10 years. This creates a
new major barrier to people wanting to start an academic career. A new
PhD graduate can either post-doc for 2-4 years, getting further behind
the curve because of inflationary pressures, or they can give up and get
an industrial role which permits them some stability.</p>
<h2 id="career-progression"><span class="headline-word">Career</span>
<span class="headline-word">progression</span></h2>
<p>On a strongly related note… The DASA grant was a significant win
pretty early on for me. It was awarded after about 6 months in-post,
which is financially very good performance as far as the university is
concerned. I applied for a spine-point uplift (a ~2% pay rise) on the
basis of that success, but was declined and awarded a one-time 3% salary
bonus – to be deferred until October 2024.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the criteria for career progression within my job
was (perhaps callously) boiled down to “get a new investigator award”.
Forging ahead with a big grant like this would be a lot of work, and
apart from securing me a few more years of job security (admittedly
laudable on its own) the university has failed to make it clear that
such success is met with promotions.</p>
<h2 id="environment-at-kent"><span
class="headline-word">Environment</span> <span
class="headline-word">at</span> <span
class="headline-word">Kent</span></h2>
<p>In the REF results that were recently published, Computing at Kent
scored very well on research outputs and impact, but suffered
specifically on ‘Research Environment’. The Research Environment is a
bit of a catch-all for how well the university supports its staff
pursuing research aims. The number-one mechanism to set one university
apart from others is funding for PhD students. PhD students make the
world go round in academia, and the two-fold effect of higher research
output and better environment is a double-whammy on REF outcomes.</p>
<p>As a Research Fellow I was able to supervise PhD students, but
funding at Kent was severely lacking. With only 2 EPSRC scholarships and
1 GTA scholarship available for the whole department there is very
little to go around. The department also ties its own hands, rewarding
PIs who are successful with grants over some threshold of value to the
university with an assured PhD scholarship.</p>
<p>This combination makes the ability to get a PhD student very
challenging.</p>
<p>None of this even looks at the ethics of PhD funding in a climate of
insane pressures on teaching staff (many PhD students are compelled to
teach), and external financial pressures where the PhD stipend doesn’t
cover costs nor does it allow students to make use of in-work benefits
like free childcare. That’s a rant for a different time, though.</p>
<h2 id="management"><span class="headline-word">Management</span></h2>
<p>The University of Kent is going through its second serious
organisational restructuring since 2019. The first was called
<em>Organising for Success</em> (O4S), a euphemism for cutting
per-School administrative and management functions back and coalescing
resources into ‘Divisions’. The second that is ongoing is called
<em>Effectiveness and Efficiency</em> (EE), a euphemism for cutting
per-Division administrative and management functions back, and
coalescing them into the centre.</p>
<p>These two projects have been a violent shake-up of university
management and governance, and has left many business processes in
disarray. It has also led to head-count loss through voluntary severance
and redundancy to many people who worked in Professional Services within
the institution. This head-count loss naturally has caused a significant
loss of institutional knowledge, so many PS departments have been left
picking up the pieces while the university re-learns how to carry out
vital administrative functions. The loss of head-count has also pushed
some administrative burden down onto academic staff, and especially with
IT equipment has encouraged the centre to find one-size-fits-all
policies that do not work well at least for Computing.</p>
<h1 id="reflecting-on-stephens-experience"><span
class="headline-word">Reflecting</span> <span
class="headline-word">on</span> <span
class="headline-word">Stephen’s</span> <span
class="headline-word">experience</span></h1>
<p>As I said in the introduction, this article is really a response to
Stephen’s article from when he left Kent. Something in Stephen’s post
which resonates strongly with me is this remark:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reasons for the move are primarily personal. Of course, that
doesn’t mean they are unrelated to work… in academic jobs especially,
work is personal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kent has seen some very noticeable attrition of staff recently
(Stephen among them). Something very common in the emails we receive
about our colleagues moving on to pastures-new is the phrase “leaving
Kent for <em>personal reasons</em>”, and I don’t doubt that this is
true. Something that I think comes from a good academic job is a desire
to <em>make it work</em>. This might be a negative instinct, but in my
opinion the people who forge a path as an academic are not normally
doing so for financial gain, or for a good work/life balance. People
become academics because in their hearts they believe in the power of
research and of universities. When staff quit Kent for <em>personal
reasons</em> I can’t help shake a feeling that these reasons are the
polite way of saying that they couldn’t <em>make it work</em> at Kent.
The factors outside of work that are pulling people away are now greatly
outweighing the factors that make people want to stay.</p>
<p>Stephen’s blog is what really made this fact sink home for me, in
fact. It is rare you get to have an exit interview with your colleagues
when they move on, and there’s an air of mild unprofessionalism about
‘airing the dirty laundry’. But, if I wanted to be consummately
professional then I wouldn’t be an academic in the first place, and I
abhor the process of obscuring information behind professional facade
because it is what is <em>expected</em>.</p>
<h2 id="two-years-later"><span class="headline-word">Two</span> <span
class="headline-word">years</span> <span
class="headline-word">later</span></h2>
<p>Since Stephen wrote his post we’ve had the EE re-organisation, and a
sentiment from the upper management of the university that they wish to
pivot away from being research focussed to teaching focussed. In
Computing we are still considered to be a research active part of the
university, but we’ve also been recognised as a profitable teaching
centre. Student recruitment targets have been raised, with an ambition
to raise them again and again to dizzying numbers in subsequent years.
This has not come with a significant effort or promise for recruiting to
offset the teaching load that extra students bring. Indeed, a
significant amount of teaching effort comes from PhDs who lead classes
(GTAs), and reductions in PhD scholarships also has left a reduction in
the GTAs available to lead seminars and mark coursework.</p>
<p>While I do not teach, I work with and care about my compatriots who
do. Being a member of <em>the academy</em> allows me to build research
ideas with my colleagues in a way where the sum is (hopefully) greater
than the total of the individual parts. But that summation is not
possible when fellow academics are snowed-under by non-research duties,
or even simply burnt out even when their calendars do open up.</p>
<h1 id="reasons-to-be-hopeful"><span
class="headline-word">Reasons</span> <span
class="headline-word">to</span> <span class="headline-word">be</span>
<span class="headline-word">hopeful</span></h1>
<p>While I’ve painted a picture of gloom, I think there are still some
reasons to be optimistic about the future. For starters, providing a
research-only role with a career path all the way to professor is
unusual and to be commended. It’s a pity the path hasn’t worked out for
me, but the reasons for that are largely out of the control of the
university and won’t reflect everyone’s experience.</p>
<p>The whole sector is in a bad spot, and Kent is just about pulling
through regardless. Outside of innovative post-92 institutions and the
Russel Group there’s a big middle of “Just About Managing” Universities.
In 2019 <a
href="https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/what-we-do/policy-and-research/publications/opening-national-conversation-university#:~:text=The%20proportion%20of%20English%20universities,%25%20(2019–20).">30%
of universities</a> were being run at a deficit (Kent <em>not</em> among
them), in 2023 I suspect this proportion is far larger. The politics of
30% or more the entire HE sector collapse is clearly negative, and a
change of government feels like it is not far out now.</p>
<p>The Director of Division does seem to <em>get it</em>. He’s fairly
powerless to hold back the tide, but within his capability it does seem
he’s pushing for the best for Computing. We were awarded the largest
portion of PhD scholarships in the Division, and he appears to recognise
the importance research has to the existing staff and is looking for
that same research-drive in new staff that are being recruited.</p>
<p>The university as a whole sort of gets it too. Computing has just
been moved to a more modern larger building. This is, of course, largely
for marketing purposes to attract new undergraduate students, but the
building is nice and it does improve the conditions everyone works
in.</p>
<h1 id="what-next"><span class="headline-word">What</span> <span
class="headline-word">next?</span></h1>
<p>Leaving Kent is bitter-sweet: on one hand I’m giving up a dream job
because of pressures (largely) outside the control of myself or my
institution. On the other hand, the job I’m moving into is very exciting
and I can continue to consider myself an academic, albeit industrial. I
am going to be a Research Scientist working at NVIDIA in the
Architecture Research Group of NVResearch. At first I will be continuing
the work I did as an intern there in 2018, and working on their memory
consistency model. All going well I’ll continue to participate in the
ISO C++ standardisation process, and I will certainly continue to be an
active researcher.</p>

    <p>I study modern multi-processor computers to understand the behaviours admitted by their complex
      micro-architectural designs. My research has focussed particularly on so-called weak memory behaviours, which are
      exhibited on machines that allow out-of-order execution and caching.

    <p>These intricate behaviours present challenges for programmer reasoning. Formal models help to clarify precisely
      what is allowed, and my tools bridge the gap between mathematical formalisation and programmer intuition about
      computer behaviour. My tools make these formal models executable. This informs the development of the model by
      allowing quick refinement of definitions, and also permits a programmer to probe the behaviour of a model to grasp
      the precise meaning of a given program.

    <p>These models stand as cutting edge specifications for verification of concurrent programs executing on modern
      high-performance hardware.

    <h2>Research Associate</h2>
    <p>I am in the process of writing-up my thesis, meanwhile I am also working on the CAPC research programme, funded by the UKRI investigation into Digital Security by Design.</p>

    <p>I am open to industrial collaboration investigating weak memory behaviours and the semantics of compiler optimised programs. I am happy to work on an ad-hoc contractor basis, or as part of a traditionally funded research program, please <a href="#contact">get in touch</a>.</p>

    <h2>Postgraduate</h2>
    <p>I am a PhD candidate in the Programming Languages and Systems group at the University of Kent. I work with
      <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/mjb211/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mark Batty</a> researching weak memory
      behaviours and compiler verification. My academic profile page
      is <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/rpg/sjc205/">here</a>.

    <p>In June 2020 I received the <a href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/graduateschoolnews/2020/05/19/graduate-school-prizes-2020/" target="_blank">Kent Postgraduate Prize</a>, recognising the impact of my research.</p>

      <h3>Modular Relaxed Dependencies</h3>
    <p>Modular Relaxed Dependencies (MRD) is a denotational semantics for weak memory consistency in C and C++. As well
      as helping to define the denotation, I built an evaluation tool (MRDer) in OCaml to enable fast calculation of the
      semantics against a corpus of litmus tests. Further, I proved meta-theoretic properties about the semantics with
      respect to industry standard models of C/C++.

    <h3>PrideMM</h3>
    <p>PrideMM is a tool written in OCaml which provides an API for building Second Order logical formulae and uses
      this API to express memory models. We use cutting edge Quantified Boolean Formulae (QBF) solvers to efficiently
      simulate a new class of memory model which solve the thin-air problem. We encode the problems in a high-level
      second order logic giving us flexibility in problem expression. This then gets translated into a QBF model
      checking problem for a solver to efficiently execute.

    <h2>Grants</h2>
    <h3>Fixing the thin-air problem: ISO dissemination<br/> (<i>VeTSS, 2020</i>)</h3>
    <p>I am a named researcher and co-author of a VeTSS grant of £60,455 to persue futher integration of MRD into the ISO C++ Standard. This grant funds travel to ISO meetings, and research time for me to prepare papers ahead of these meetings.

    <h3>CAPC: Capability C semantics, tools and reasoning<br/> (<i>Digital Security by Design, 2020)</i></h3>
    <p>I am a named researcher and co-author of a Digital Security by Design grant of £596,634. This is a longer term project to build verified concurrent libraries for the CHERI platform. CHERI is an interesting extension to ARM where memory accesses are tagged with capabilities to keep code secure.

    <h2>Industrial Experience</h2>
    <h3>NVIDIA</h3>
    <p>As an intern at NVIDIA I extended the Memory Consistency Model for NVIDIA’s virtual instruction set (PTX) to
      support "memory views". This enables writing well defined programs which mix generic load and store operations
      with specialised load and store operations for texture, surface and constant accesses.</p>
    
    <h3>XMOS</h3>
    <p>I worked for the Bristol based semiconductor company <a href="http://www.xmos.com/">XMOS</a>. XMOS
      produce a line of multi-core embedded processors called the xCORE. I built tools and
      applications for the platform, including a port of an MP3 library, <tt><a href="https://github.com/graymalkin/lib_mp3/">lib_mp3</a></tt> and
      adaptations to their debugging toolchain to enable remote debugging of hardware targets over the network, and to
      allow interfacing the debugger with a fast simulator.</p>

    <h2>Undergraduate</h2>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Kent with a First in <i>Computer Science with a Year in Industry</i>.</p>
    
    <h3>TinkerSoc</h3>
    <p>I was the president of <a href="http://tinkersoc.org/">TinkerSoc</a>, a society dedicated to making things,
      particularly electronics.

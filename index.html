    I am a Research Fellow in Programming Languages at the University of Kent, as part of the Programming Languages and Systems Research Group.

    <h2>Research Fellow</h2>
    <p>I am working on the <i>Complementing Capabilities</i> research proje ct to bring the Rust programming language to Morello.</p>

    <p>I am open to industrial collaboration investigating weak memory behaviours and the semantics of compiler optimised programs. I am happy to work on an ad-hoc contractor basis, or as part of a traditionally funded research program, please <a href="#contact">get in touch</a>.</p>

    <h2>Postgraduate</h2>
    <p>I completed my PhD in the Programming Languages and Systems group at the University of Kent.
    I worked with my supervisor  <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/mjb211/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mark Batty</a> researching weak memory behaviours and compiler verification.</p>

    <p>In June 2020 I received the <a href="https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/graduateschoolnews/2020/05/19/graduate-school-prizes-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kent Postgraduate Prize</a>, recognising the impact of my research.</p>

    <h3>Mixed-Proxy Extensions to NVIDIA PTX</h3>
    <p>An extension of NVIDIA's PTX ISA to support mixing load and store operations that target different proxies of memory. 
    This gives well-defined semantics to programs with both, for example, constant loads and generic stores to the same address. 
    The memory model extension was built in the relational model checking tool, Alloy, and we showed that our extension to the PTX model is sound and complete with respect to the existing industrial model.

    <h3>Pomsets with Predicate Transformers</h3>
    <p>Pomsets with Predicate Transformers (PwT) is a recent fully denotational semantics for weak memory consistency.
    It captures program dependencies by embedding a logic into predicate transformers which compose to create proof
    burdens necessary to remove dependencies which are syntactic only from list of dependencies actually present in a
    program. I developed an OCaml tool to automatically evaluate PwT over a series of litmus tests. <i>Appears in the proceedings of POPL 2022.</i></p>

    <h3>Modular Relaxed Dependencies</h3>
    <p>Modular Relaxed Dependencies (MRD) is a denotational semantics for weak memory consistency in C and C++. As well
      as helping to define the denotation, I built an evaluation tool (MRDer) in OCaml to enable fast calculation of the
      semantics against a corpus of litmus tests. Further, I proved meta-theoretic properties about the semantics with
      respect to industry standard models of C/C++.</p>

    <h3>PrideMM</h3>
    <p>PrideMM is a tool written in OCaml which provides an API for building Second Order logical formulae and uses
      this API to express memory models. We use cutting edge Quantified Boolean Formulae (QBF) solvers to efficiently
      simulate a new class of memory model which solve the thin-air problem. We encode the problems in a high-level
      second order logic giving us flexibility in problem expression. This then gets translated into a QBF model
      checking problem for a solver to efficiently execute.</p>

    <h2>Grants</h2>
    <h3>Complementing capabilities: introducing pointer-safe programming to DSBD tech<br/>
    (<i>Innovate UK ICSF, 2022</i>)</h3>
    <p>I am a Researcher Co-Investigator for a grant of £494,770 (80% FEC) responding to the Innovate UK call to extend the DSbD ecosystem with new CHERI-compatible software. This work will be focussed on porting the Rust compiler to CHERI and formally demonstrating how the guarantees provided by Rust join up nicely with the guarantees of the capability hardware.</p>

    <h3>Fixing the thin-air problem: ISO dissemination<br/> (<i>VeTSS, 2020</i>)</h3>
    <p>I am a named researcher and co-author of a VeTSS grant of £60,455 (80% FEC) to pursue further integration of MRD into the ISO C++ Standard. This grant funds travel to ISO meetings, and research time for me to prepare papers ahead of these meetings.</p>

    <h3>CAPC: Capability C semantics, tools and reasoning<br/> (<i>Digital Security by Design, 2020)</i></h3>
    <p>I am a named researcher and co-author of a Digital Security by Design grant of £485,168 (80% FEC). This is a longer term project to build verified concurrent libraries for the CHERI platform. CHERI is an interesting extension to ARM where memory accesses are tagged with capabilities to keep code secure.</p>

    <h2>Industrial Experience</h2>
    <h3>NVIDIA</h3>
    <p>As an intern at NVIDIA I extended the Memory Consistency Model for NVIDIA’s virtual instruction set (PTX) to
      support "memory views". This enables writing well defined programs which mix generic load and store operations
      with specialised load and store operations for texture, surface and constant accesses.</p>
    
    <h3>XMOS</h3>
    <p>I worked for the Bristol based semiconductor company <a href="http://www.xmos.com/">XMOS</a>. XMOS
      produce a line of multi-core embedded processors called the xCORE. I built tools and
      applications for the platform, including a port of an MP3 library, <tt><a href="https://github.com/graymalkin/lib_mp3/">lib_mp3</a></tt> and
      adaptations to their debugging toolchain to enable remote debugging of hardware targets over the network, and to
      allow interfacing the debugger with a fast simulator.</p>

    <h2>Undergraduate</h2>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Kent with a First in <i>Computer Science with a Year in Industry</i>.</p>
    
    <h3>TinkerSoc</h3>
    <p>I was the president of <a href="http://tinkersoc.org/">TinkerSoc</a>, a society dedicated to making things,
      particularly electronics.</p>

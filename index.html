<p>I am a Research Fellow in Programming Languages at the University of
Kent, as part of the Programming Languages and Systems Research Group. I
am working on the <em>Complementing Capabilities</em> research project

<p>Memory safety issues are a serious concern in systems programming.
Rust is a systems language that provides memory safety through a
combination of a static checks embodied in the type system and ad hoc
dynamic checks inserted where this analysis becomes impractical. The
Morello prototype architecture from ARM uses capabilities, fat pointers
augmented with object bounds information, to catch failures of memory
safety. This paper presents a compiler from Rust to the Morello
architecture, together with a comparison of the performance of Rust’s
runtime safety checks and the hardware-supported checks of Morello. The
cost of Morello’s always-on memory safety guarantees is 39% in our 19
benchmark suites from the Rust crates repository (comprising 872 total
benchmarks). For this cost, Morello’s capabilities ensure that even
unsafe Rust code benefits from memory safety guarantees.</p>

<p>An extension of NVIDIA’s PTX ISA to support mixing load and store
operations that target different proxies of memory. This gives
well-defined semantics to programs with both, for example, constant
loads and generic stores to the same address. The memory model extension
was built in the relational model checking tool, Alloy, and we showed
that our extension to the PTX model is sound and complete with respect
to the existing industrial model.</p>

<p>Pomsets with Predicate Transformers (PwT) is a recent fully
denotational semantics for weak memory consistency. It captures program
dependencies by embedding a logic into predicate transformers which
compose to create proof burdens necessary to remove dependencies which
are syntactic only from list of dependencies actually present in a
program. I developed an OCaml tool to automatically evaluate PwT over a
series of litmus tests. Appears in the proceedings of POPL 2022.</p>

<p>Modular Relaxed Dependencies (MRD) is a denotational semantics for
weak memory consistency in C and C++. As well as helping to define the
denotation, I built an evaluation tool (MRDer) in OCaml to enable fast
calculation of the semantics against a corpus of litmus tests. Further,
I proved meta-theoretic properties about the semantics with respect to
industry standard models of C/C++.</p>

<p>PrideMM is a tool written in OCaml which provides an API for building
Second Order logical formulae and uses this API to express memory
models. We use cutting edge Quantified Boolean Formulae (QBF) solvers to
efficiently simulate a new class of memory model which solve the
thin-air problem. We encode the problems in a high-level second order
logic giving us flexibility in problem expression. This then gets
translated into a QBF model checking problem for a solver to efficiently
execute.</p>

Batty</a> researching weak memory behaviours and compiler
verification.</p>
<p>In June 2020 I received the <a

<p>As an intern at NVIDIA I extended the Memory Consistency Model for
NVIDIA’s virtual instruction set (PTX) to support “memory views”. This
enables writing well-defined programs which mix generic load and store
operations with specialised load and store operations for texture,
surface and constant accesses.</p>
<h3 id="xmos"><span class="headline-word">XMOS</span></h3>
<p>I worked for the Bristol based semiconductor company <a
href="https://www.xmos.com">XMOS</a>. XMOS produce a line of multi-core
embedded processors called the xCORE. I built tools and applications for
the platform, including a port of an MP3 library, <code>lib_mp3</code>
and adaptations to their debugging toolchain to enable remote debugging
of hardware targets over the network, and to allow interfacing the
debugger with a fast simulator.</p>
